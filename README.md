# Replace Background Music in R-Type Final 2

This is a series of `PAK Mod` files, each replacing a specific background music track in the game. Please download the desired mods from [Releases](https://github.com/BLACKujira/RTypeFinal2MusicMod/releases/tag/250130) and follow the [PAK Mod Installation Guide](https://github.com/BLACKujira/RTF2ModdingGuide/blob/master/Chapter1_TheBasics/en/InstallingPAKMods.md) to install them.

- If you install *multiple mods that replace the same track*, only one will be effective.
- Sometimes there may be a pause when entering the loop segment of the music; the cause is currently unknown.
